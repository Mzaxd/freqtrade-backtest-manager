# Enhancement Impact Analysis - K-line Chart Feature

### Files That Will Need Modification

Based on the epic requirements for K-line chart enhancement:

- `src/app/[locale]/backtests/[id]/page.tsx` - Already has "K线图" tab with EnhancedTradingChart, needs performance optimization
- `src/components/EnhancedTradingChart.tsx` - Component exists but needs performance improvements for large datasets
- `src/app/api/backtests/[id]/chart-data/route.ts` - API exists but needs optimization for data preprocessing
- `src/types/chart.ts` - May need extensions for enhanced chart features

### New Files/Modules Needed

- **Performance Optimizations**: Virtualized rendering or data aggregation for large datasets
- **Enhanced API Endpoints**: Optimized data endpoints with better caching and preprocessing
- **Chart Interaction Improvements**: Better zoom, pan, and crosshair functionality

### Integration Considerations

- **Existing Tab Structure**: K-line tab already exists in backtest detail page
- **Data Pipeline**: Multi-source data retrieval already implemented
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Large candlestick datasets may cause frontend performance issues
- **Real-time Updates**: Existing polling mechanism may need optimization
